# Responsive Font Weights for Visual Studio Code

Responsive Font Weights allows you to change the font weight based on ranges of the font size.

## Extension Settings

This extension modifies the standard zoom in and out keys to only do fonts. If you want to resize Visual Studio Code itself, then hold the `[SHIFT]` key when resizing.
